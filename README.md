# GoComets-AirlineReservationSys

This project is about booking flights online. This website has SignUp for new users and a login for existing users. 
Admin uses the same login interface as the regular users except that admin will be able to add / view/ update flights. 
Once the user creates an account with valid credentials, he/she is redirected to the MyTrips page. In the MyTrips Page, 
a user can see the Booked flights and status of the flights. In the home page, a user can search the flights by selecting 
FROM city and TO city from the dropdown list. A user can filter his/her search based on the round trip or one-way flight. 
Once the user clicks on search flight button, the list of Onward Flights and Return Flights will be displayed. 
User Can select from the available list of flights and book the flight. When the user moves ahead with booking the Flight, 
he/she must enter the details about Name, DOB, Meal, Preference and the number of co-passengers travelling along with user.
After filling out all the details, the flight will be booked Successfully and take the user to MyTrips page. 
The admin has the privileges to add a new flight, cancel flight and view all the flights. 
When the flight is cancelled by admin, error message will be displayed in the userâ€™s MyTrips page for those who 
have booked the flight which was cancelled by admin.
